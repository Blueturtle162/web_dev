       <p>Insulin resistance is a phenomenon that occurs when your body builds up a resistance to insulin. When your pancreas releases insulin it tells your body that your sugar levels are too high so it allows your body to store excess sugar. If insulin is constantly getting released your body slowly becomes used to higher levels of insulin and builds up a resistance. This can eventually lead to diabetes, metabolic syndrome and a variety of other health problems. Symptoms of insulin resistance can include:</p>

       <p>One way to avoid building up insulin resistance is regulating your diet and avoiding sugars and processed foods. Regulating your diet is key to avoiding insulin resistance. If you are constantly eating  sugary foods and drinks your body becomes accustomed to high levels of insulin. Most processed foods also contain fructose which prompts the same insulin response as sugar. Eating a balanced diet with fiber, fruits, vegetables, fats, and proteins can help significantly lower the amount of insulin released after each meal.</p>
